MechChess
=========

MechChess is an interactive chess game that tracks the game, the clock, and shows the legal moves while you play. It is implemented using an Arduino Mega 2560 an custom electronics. Documentation to build your own hardware can be found at BROKEN_LINK.
The code in this repository can be useful if:

  - You are building your own chess game.
  - You are implementing a matrix style electronics driver for LEDS or Switch sensors (Hall sensors where used)
  - You need a basic representation of a chessgame suitable for a microcontroller
